        <center><h1>My Hobbies</h1></center>
        <p>I don't have any hobbies to put me in a cool-boy category(ðŸ‘º). Still my hobbies include: -
          <ul>
              <li>Smoking weed and thinking about 'n' number of stupid things and making stupid conclusions out of it.</li>
              <li>Listening to different musics.</li>
              <li>Jogging, I love jogging, it makes me feel very good.</li>
              <li>Reading Books, I was an avid reader before 2020, but this lockdown spoiled my habbit, but today also I try to read
               a lot, if not as much as before.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          I guess that's all I have to share in this hobby section of my personal website.
          If somebody is really checking out this website then god knows, why you even give a fuck about me.
