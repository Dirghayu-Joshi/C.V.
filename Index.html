This website is all about me, it has a general idea of what I want to be like in future.
It is very narcissistic to talk about oneself but none will accept it that it is one of the most
enjoyable things. And I am going to have so much fun making this website, all about myself.

    <h3>I am Dirghayu Joshi and I have already put my name on this website a zillion times.
     I am passionate about computer and my favourite web-series is Mr. Robot. Other then that I want
     to live a life, where I spend my time on reading books, rearing animals and farming my own food.
     I also want to write some book at some point in my life. I am currently learning web development
     to earn money out of it.
     I also will establish a Corporation with the name <strong>"The Mega Corporation"</strong> that
     will outlive me and have some impact on this world. To be honest, I don't care about positive
     or negative impact, I just want to create an impact, I want to matter.</h3>

    <h2>My filosophy of life.</h2>
    <p>It feels so narcissistic to just talk about myself, but I am enjoying it personally. I believe
     that one should not critique anyone as none is perfect and we are just a bunch of egocentric creatures
     living in a rock on an infinite space, so nothing doesn't really matters as big as we make a
     deal of it.</p>
